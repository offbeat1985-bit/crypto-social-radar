## Signals and adversarial checks
No qualifying signals recorded.

## Model improvement proposals
- Increase verified source coverage before changing scoring weights.
- Add contract-level token disambiguation and historical backtesting.
- Maintain a frozen baseline and evaluate changes only on subsequent unseen data.

## Important caveats
- Public RSS does not cover all coins or all social media.
- No historical price data ingestion is included, so this version cannot demonstrate profitable prediction.
- A GitHub scheduled job is not guaranteed to run at the exact time; free quotas and platform terms may change.

## Forward-only price validation

- Latest price feed: 2026-10-17 / ok / coingecko: 100 coin prices; 1 signal assets; 0 DEX contracts
- Saved price snapshots: 100
- Matched asset predictions: 0
- Top-100 ticker matches or Ethereum contract-address DEX matches only; no backfilled entries. CoinPaprika is an outage fallback, not an interchangeable historical ID.
### 1-day validation
- Agent A candidates: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent B supported: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent A rejected by B: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
### 3-day validation
- Agent A candidates: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent B supported: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent A rejected by B: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
### 7-day validation
- Agent A candidates: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent B supported: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
- Agent A rejected by B: n=0; insufficient observations or BTC benchmark
Scores are not probabilities. BTC is a benchmark, not a matched random-signal control. Small samples cannot establish predictive skill.
